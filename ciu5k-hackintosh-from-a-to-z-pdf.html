She said it was broken because Chrome, Firefox, apps, etc. all told her she needed a newer OSX, but that when she went to software update, it said the device was up to date. She figured that Apple had dropped support for it, and that it was unusable. For the entirety of our relationship I never questioned that because I thought well, it's at least 6 years.

I've been mostly just lurking over the past few weeks, but if it weren't for all the great tutorials and guides that this community compiled, I don't think I would have ever managed to get to this point. Seeing how much all of this helped me, I thought it would only be fair to pay things forward by posting about my own journey.

It's been a while since I tried a Hackintosh setup (built a CustoMac Mini back in the Lion days) and I'm having a bit of trouble getting back into it! I'm trying to get High Sierra installed on my MSI Trident 3 (VR7RC-028US, here's (https://us.msi.com/pdf/desktop/Trident%203%20VR7RC-028US%20Microsoft.pdf) the spec sheet if anyone needs a little more info) and haven't been able to boot from a USB drive I made with UniBeast. I'm able to get to Clover but when I get to actually booting macOS. So last week I updated a few things and now (I didn't use it much for a week) I'm noticing that a few things are corrupt. It does mostly work, but the few things are critical. iBooks cannot find it's helper application, so while I can still load books into it, and it goes to iCloud (so it works on my iPad), I can actually only read PDFs, not eBooks. eBooks fail silently.

I'm putting together a hackintosh as my main home computer. Will also be using it for some heavy data science tasks for work (hence, the GTX 1080 and the NZXT H440 case, as I eventually plan to add several HDDs). I've picked up the chip and the motherboard (used), but haven't purchased any other components yet. My main questions are: PSU : Should I get a 750w PSU instead of the 650? I have no idea how adequate the 650 is. Will it keep me from building out much more? SSD : Any recomme.

EDITED: To anyone interested, the issue was graphics! When I wrote this post, I was updating to 10.12.5 but have got my system up and running again with 10.12.6. I did suspect my iffy Intel 530 graphics might have been the issue because the loading bar would pause right at the point where the Apple logo would shatter into a million pieces right before giving way to the login screen (not sure if this happens on anyone else's system). In the end, I did two things; one of which fixed my system. "Hackintosh from A to Z" - Настольная книга любого Хакинтошника. Данная книга написана далеко не последними людми на ХакОс сцене.

Peter Baldwin - OS x86 Creating a Hackintosh - 2010.pdf I'm currently in the market for a new (to me, anyways) laptop, to be able to free my life from sitting in front of my desktop all of the time. The place I've moved into is close by to a local park, and with summer coming up, I might like to be able to liberate away from the desk, and be able to enjoy my hobbies and interests on the go.

I am finishing up my University degree, and will be back home in a few months.

My set up the past few years is that whenever i'm home my MBP is hooked up to my 27" monitor and speakers, along with a keyboard and mouse, essentially a pseudo-iMac set up. Aside from school.

Hey all, Posting a new thread here for a new issue. My hackintosh is up and running, relatively stable. I have one, and only one issue. I seem to have the 780 card that has the Open CL issue, specifically I notice it when I attempt to open Preview.

I can get a Dell R710 or R720 and from looking at them they both have nice Xeon processors which by themselves would make a build much more affordable if I just rip them out. However otherwise the systems are reasonably simple with some PCI-e slots and lots of RAM and some internal drives, so ideally I'd want to just turn the whole server into a hackintosh, add a decent video Enjoy The Silence - Hackintosh from A to Z - 2010.pdf 13.29. i can't find a tool that is able to (a) show annotations that I did on a mac with the Preview app and (b) that i can use to do highlights. I can live without annotations, but highlighting is crucial. I read a great deal of academic papers, but if i can't do hightlighting that would be a dealbreaker for my workflow (centered around jabref amp texmaker). i switched from my hackintosh to mint and everything else works like a charm! edit: it is also crucial that the highlights are stored natively.
